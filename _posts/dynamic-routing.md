### My Background

When my family immigrated to the US, it was difficult to get used to the language, culture, and new peers. In a world of all things new and foreign, I quickly took comfort in playing and socializing through video games. The shutdown of my childhood video game is the strange reason I started programming and dabbling in design in the first place. When I was 11, I programmed my first unusable, hot pink recreation of a discontinued "Pixie Hollow" (Disney MMORPG). There's no doubt that gaming has shaped who I am today and I am determined to break into the industry
