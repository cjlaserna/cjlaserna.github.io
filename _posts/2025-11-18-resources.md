This page covers resources and materials for people new to programming or design. It encompasses resources I reference frequently, ones that have affected my career, and my own personally crafted resources!

## **Personally Crafted Resources**

### **Programming**

It has slides, homework, and resources.
    
*   [AI Workshop](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XGhtTffxeFqzBvYBf7Gt9P9bbQ_3hOVs?usp=sharing) - For a shorter lesson, I also have a one-pager focused solely on introducing people to **NLP** and **AI** in general. It comes with a short activity as well.

*   [OOP Curriculum Notes and Resources](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BxFnCR08vrrLIQx3FtoFhoNciVMlPxwy?usp=sharing) \- I taught **OOP** (object-oriented programming) to students at one point and these are the notes and resources I noted down.
