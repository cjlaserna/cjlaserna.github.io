I've been working on this portfolio site the past couple of days. I feel like I should've done this sooner! Using PagesCMS has certainly made things a lot simpler and easier for me. I might use it for future projects. I feel a bit rusty with NextJS since I haven't used it in a while but I think this turned out well.
