Comfi started as a pitchathon project a few years ago, originally created as a quick concept for a lightweight, cozy-focused app. I recently revisited the design and gave it a fresh, cleaner look. This project is purely a design prototype, built in Figma, with a focus on minimalistic UI, soft visuals, and simple user flow onboarding. It explores how a calm, comfort-centered digital experience might look and feel, using modern design principles and low-noise layouts.

While Comfi isn’t a fully developed product, it serves as a polished prototype and a snapshot of how my design skills have evolved.
