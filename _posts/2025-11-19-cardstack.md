**CardStack** is a lightweight flashcard web app built with **Create React App**, designed to make studying quick, simple, and flexible. I created the project with a focus on clean UI, LaTeX-friendly cards, and a smooth, minimal workflow for learners.

The app uses:

*   **React.js** for building interactive UI
    
*   **Chakra UI** for clean, accessible components
    
*   **Supabase** as the backend (a modern, open-source Firebase alternative)
    
*   **Node.js**, **HTML5**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for core functionality
    

The goal of CardStack is straightforward: provide an easy way to create and review flashcards—with LaTeX support for equations and technical notes. Over time, I plan to expand it with additional features and more advanced components.
