_Teyvat Travel Notes_ is a small web app I built while experimenting with **Next.js** and modern frontend tooling. The project was scaffolded with **create-next-app**, giving me a clean foundation to explore layouts, routing, and styling while keeping everything lightweight.

I used **Next.js 13+ (App Router)** along with **TypeScript** for type-safety and **Tailwind CSS** for fast, utility-based styling. The setup includes ESLint and Prettier for formatting, plus Next.js’ built-in font optimization using `next/font`.

Although it started as a simple experiment, _Teyvat Travel Notes_ became a great playground for testing Next.js features and building small UI components inspired by Genshin Impact’s aesthetic. It’s deployed through **Vercel**, which made the process smooth and almost instant.
