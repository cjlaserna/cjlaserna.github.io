**NookOffice** is a relaxing productivity web app inspired by Animal Crossing: New Horizons. It hosts hourly rotating ACNH music, making it perfect for studying, working, or just creating a peaceful atmosphere. I built it using **Astro**, with styling handled in **CSS** and a bit of **JavaScript** for interactivity.

The app includes a set of simple, cozy tools:

*   **Hourly Animal Crossing music rotation**
    
*   **Optional rain sound layering**
    
*   **Locally saved to-do list** so tasks persist between sessions
    
*   **5, 10, and 15-minute timers** for quick focus sessions
    

Most of the GIFs come from the official _Animal Crossing_ movie/anime, and additional artwork is credited to **Saino**. The project is deployed on **Netlify**, and I use the **YouTube Embed API** to manage music playback.
